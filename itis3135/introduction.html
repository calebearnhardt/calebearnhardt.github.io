        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b></li>I was born and raised in Mocksville, NC and have lived there my entire life.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b></li>Although I don’t have much of a background in computer science, I have worked many part time customer service jobs and currently work part time at a golf course.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b></li>I am a junior here at UNCC and I’m majoring in Computer Science planning on getting my degree in cybersecurity.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b></li>Macboook.</li>
            <li><b>Programming/Software Background:</b></li>I have some experience in Java from 1212 and 1213.</li>
            <li><b>Courses:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135:</b> This course is required for my major, but I am interested in web development and building websites.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3146:</b> I’m taking this course because it is required but it also is very important and helpful in learning how operating systems work in a computer and as well as networking.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3155:</b> This class is also required for my major and I think it will be fun to work in groups and tackle group projects because I feel like that is similar to the real world and how teams work together.</li>
                    <li><b>MATH 2164:</b> This is another required class for my major.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
