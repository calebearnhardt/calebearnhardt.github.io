        <h2>Nelson, Ann</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed:</strong> There was a clickable link to this page on the course page.</li>
            <li><strong>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names:</strong> Everything looks correct — no spaces or uppercase letters in the filenames.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read:</strong> Text is readable. Font size fits the page well. Contrast between text and background could be improved slightly in some areas, but overall it's easy to read.</li>
            <li><strong>Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file:</strong> There is a CSS file being used to apply the site's styles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CRAP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Overall contrast is good, but the navbar blends into the header because the colors are very close. A little more contrast between the navbar and header would make it stand out better.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of font styles, colors, and layouts across the page. Good repetition.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is aligned well — headings, paragraphs, and image gallery all flow in an organized way.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are grouped properly. No major spacing issues noticed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Page has within it:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: Yes.</li>
            <li>Main: Yes.</li>
            <li>Footer: Yes.</li>
            <li>Navbar: Yes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Header specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header has site/brand header in an h1:</strong> Yes — "BrushedNBuilt" is in an &lt;h1&gt; element.</li>
            <li><strong>Each page title has the site name and page name separated by a divider:</strong>Overall looks good except do not see a divider between sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and doesn't include the name:</strong> "Home" appears as the &lt;h2&gt;, which is good.</li>
            <li><strong>Page has brand tagline somewhere:</strong> Tagline appears on the Home page inside a light box. Recommend adding it across all pages or into the header for stronger branding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Footer specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Menu for user's pages:</strong> Footer has the "Designed by Nelson-Inc." message, but doesn't include full user navigation links. Recommend adding a full menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Validation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML validation: Looks good to me.</li>
            <li>CSS validation: Looks good to me.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specific Requirements for Assignment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop functional HTML and CSS for 5 pages: Done.</li>
            <li>Home page with content named index.html: Done.</li>
            <li>Navigation bar: Done.</li>
            <li>Content on 4 other pages: Done.</li>
            <li>Who, what, where, when, why content: Done, described in the artist bio and artwork explanations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Things I Noticed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Great professional look and easy navigation overall.</li>
            <li>Recommend increasing navbar contrast slightly so it stands out from the header more.</li>
            <li>Double-check to add accumulus.</li>
        </ul>
