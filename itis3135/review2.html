        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed:</strong> There was a clickable link to this page on the course page. Easy to find.</li>
            <li><strong>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names:</strong> Everything looks good — no spaces or uppercase letters in the filenames.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read:</strong> Very easy to read. Excellent font choices and sizing. Strong contrast between text and background.</li>
            <li><strong>Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file:</strong> Uses a consistent CSS file to style the entire site, very professional appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CRAP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent contrast. Especially the black/orange theme against a light background.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Design is consistent across all pages. Fonts, colors, layout stay the same.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is lined up very well — navigation, content, and images are well structured and centered.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements (like headings and paragraphs) are grouped together nicely, easy to scan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Page has within it:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Header: Yes.</li>

            <li>Footer: Yes.</li>
            <li>Navbar: Yes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Header specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header has site/brand header in an h1:</strong> Yes — "Maxwell Petersen" is properly in an &lt;h1&gt;.</li>
            <li><strong>Each page title has the site name and page name separated by a divider:</strong> Appears very clean. However, make sure the divider is visible in the browser tab titles if not already (small detail to double-check).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and doesn't include the name:</strong> Correct usage, clean h2s for each page section.</li>
            <li><strong>Page has brand tagline somewhere:</strong> Good tagline under the image: "Innovative Engineering Solutions". Very fitting and clear branding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Footer specifics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Menu for user's pages:</strong> Footer seems simple — might benefit from additional links to major sections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Validation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML validation: Appears good.</li>
            <li>CSS validation: Appears good.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specific Requirements for Assignment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop functional HTML and CSS for 5 pages: Done (Home, About, Projects, Contact, plus content-rich sections).</li>
            <li>Home page with content named index.html: Done.</li>
            <li>Navigation bar: Done — fully functional.</li>
            <li>Content on 4 other pages: Done.</li>
            <li>Who, what, where, when, why content: Addressed throughout the About and Projects pages very well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Things I Noticed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extremely professional look — feels like a portfolio ready for real-world use.</li>
            <li>The orange highlight color makes important actions (like the "About Me" button) stand out well.</li>
            <li>Great job combining visual design with clean structure — very few changes needed.</li>
            <li>Minor suggestion: Add footer navigation links to improve sitewide navigation.</li>
        </ul>
